# Hey, I'm Tyler and I'm a Game Designer

### I enjoy making prototype mechanics for games to push the <br> existing boundaries game genres place on themselves.

I'm interested in working elements of world-building, <br>folklore, biology, and archaeology into my projects and <br>am always game to collaborate on these.

I'm looking to break into the games industry in a game design role, and will consider all offers.
